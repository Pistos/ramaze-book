# Ramaze, the book

The offical book for the [Ramaze web application framework](http://ramaze.net).

## General information

A work in progress to create a compilation of:

* frequently asked questions
* meta-information
* best practices
* in-depth discussions
* anything else...

This is a community effort, initiated by Michael 'manveru' Fellinger, Ramaze
developer and passionate Rubyist.

The source is kept in a git repository at
[github](http://github.com/manveru/ramaze-book)

## Dependencies

The book is written using the LyX editor, the source directory contains the
snippets used througout the book and are highlighted dynamically on LaTeX
generation using the `highlight` utility written by
[Andre Simon](http://www.andre-simon.de).

## Todo

Adding instructions to setup TeX and highlighting as described on the LyX wiki
but specific for Ruby.
