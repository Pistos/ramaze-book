Preface
=======

Ramaze is a simple but powerful web application development framework. This
book is an in-depth walk-through of Ramaze's features and behaviour.

Ramaze is a modular web application framework.
It provides you with just about everything you need to make your daily web
development simple and fun.
Making programming fun is a concept popularized by the Ruby programming
language.

It is written in Ruby. This book assumes at least basic knowledge about
Ruby.
If you do not know what Ruby is yet, visit http://ruby-lang.org[ruby-lang.org],
the official website for the Ruby programming language and find out; but
beware, it may change your life.

It features a readable open source codebase licensed under the Ruby license
(optionally GPL version 2).

The strengths of Ramaze, as described by its users, are a free style of
development, affording all the benefits of the underlying Ruby programming
language. It gets out of your way as you do things, helping you along as you
require it.
